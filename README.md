# MineScript
MineScript is a language and a compiler. 

### MineScript Language
MineScript is a language used to easily create complex Minecraft functions.
It gives you access to conditions, loops and variables inside your code. 
Using it, you can create:
- Datapacks easier to maintain and to understand;
- Complex animations in a few lines;
- Mod-like features;
- Everything you can do with vanilla functions, but easier and faster.

### MineScript compiler
To be understood by Minecraft, MineScript files have to be compiled into .mcfunction files. 
This is what this project does: it gives you a way to compile your .minescript files into working functions.
